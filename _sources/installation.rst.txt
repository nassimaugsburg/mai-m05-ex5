Installation
------------

This package depends on numpy_ and scipy_ to run properly. Please install a
modern version of these packages before trying to run the code examples.  I
recommend the miniconda_ package manager for this work, but your mileage may
vary.

To download a copy of this package, clone it from its repository in GitHub:

.. code:: sh

   $ git clone git@github.com:idiap/mai-m05-ex5 project
   $ cd project
   $ conda create -n project python=3.8 numpy scipy
   $ conda activate project
   (project) $ #you are ready to run baselines!

.. include:: links.rst
